# Park'n Drive

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).


## First steps

Before all, you'll need some requirements.

With apt, you'll need to install the mysql suite 5.6, build-essentials, python 2.7.X, git.

Run this: 

```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-apt-config_0.8.0-1_all.deb
dpkg -i mysql-apt-config_0.8.0-1_all.deb
apt-get update && apt-get install mysql-server build-essential git python2.7
```
Verify node & npm are already on your computer (`node -v` & `npm -v`, if not [try this](http://www.nearform.com/nodecrunch/nodejs-sudo-free/)), then execute this:

```bash
npm config set python /path/to/python 	# Use `whereis python` if you are unsure
npm install -g strongloop   # This won't work if you have less than 1Go of RAM
npm install -g bower
```

Then, run `npm install` and `bower install` to be up to date with all the components.

Finally, create the file `server/datasources.json` in which you will write:

```javascript
{
  "db": {
    "name": "db",
    "connector": "memory"
  },
  "sql": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",                  // The ip of the host of MySQL
    "port": 3306,                       // MySQL port (3306 by default)
    "database": "parkndrive",
    "name": "sql",
    "user": "root",                     // Name of sql user
    "password": "5up3rs3cr3tp455w0rd"   // Password of sql user
    "connector": "mysql"
  }
}
```

You will also have to execute both files in `/sql` in order to create your database and populate it.


## Launch the project

That's quite easy: run `node .` in the root folder of parkndrive.

If you want to debug, just run `node debug .`.
